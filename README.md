# Console Game
## Overview
This projected was created as a way to develop my skills in c++ and object oriented programming. The project is a arena based text game inside the console.
## Objectives
1. Be able to save and load the players stats.
2. Create random enemies for the player to fight.
3. Create a stat sheet in a .txt file for the player to be able to open.
## Running the Code
### Arena
- In the arena, players will be presented with a randomly generated enemies and will then be able to run from the fight or continue to the fight.
- If the player chooses to fight, each turn they will have the oppurtunity to either attack the enemy or to use a potion(which can be bought from the stores).
- After each player turn, the enemy gets to attack. This will repeat until someone is defeated.
- If the player wins, they will recieve gold based on the enemies health.
### Stores
#### Potion Store
- In this store, the player will be able to choose from the different potions in the game to help aid them in the battle if they have the gold to buy it.
#### Equipment Store
- When entering this store, random armor and weapons will be created for the user to buy.
- The prices are calculated off of the stats of the equipment.
#### Stats Store
- In this store, the player can build up their stats by buying upgrades for the possible player stats
## Future Goals
1. Allow there to be multple player save.
2. Give the enemy more options than attack.
3. Allow a better arena experience for the player.
